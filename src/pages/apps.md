<p>I train quite a lot, and with that comes proper nutrition control, I make use of MFP for tracking food, however, it only imports exercise activities from external data sources, which is by no means a complete picture.</p>
<p>As an Apple user, I was also not able to find an easy way to get the data I wanted out, not even with Shortcuts.</p>
<p>I simply wanted a quick glance at my caloric status, am I in deficit or surplus.</p>
<p>This app, while probably an over engineered solution, deals with that, it takes in teh Active, Resting and Dietary energy from AppleHealth and does just that, displays you intake, your output and the difference</p>

<p>A small app to help you calculate the cost of printing your 3D models.</p>
<p>While there are many other out there, I saw none that were both simple for a quick personal check, and allowed you to enter the actual wattage of your printer, which an essential value in an accurate calculation.</p>

<p>A simple web app for users to track their progress across the <a href="https://www.f45playoffs.com/">F45 Playoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Keeping things simple, you can use this app to track both your current Playoffs or add in past results that you may still have and get a look at your progress.</p>
