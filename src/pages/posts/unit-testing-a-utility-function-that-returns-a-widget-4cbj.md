Probably not too common a use case, but for me I have a utility function for handling in-app navigation from the in-app web view webview\_flutter while it does have a generic error handler, I need to be handle errors differently based on what type of URL was selected as custom logic is required to be able to handle links that are not actually valid.

A snippet from the utility mentioned above:


<iframe class="liquidTag" src="https://dev.to/embed/gist?args=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2FRemeJuan%2Fdc09ef02c6fe4301b59de866854b5a0d" style="border: 0; width: 100%;"></iframe>


In this case, groups is a URL path that we currently do not support within the flutter app, so there is other logic specifically for groups, but for brevitiy we will reference the generic \_handleUnsupported function which returns a Snacbar with a localized error message.

Normally with a utility test, one would simply use expect, however in this case the functions result would be a visual element, so before we can expect anything, we need to setup a test to allow all the logic to run.


<iframe class="liquidTag" src="https://dev.to/embed/gist?args=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2FRemeJuan%2Fbde3586378ec02935b10bc54623b2833" style="border: 0; width: 100%;"></iframe>


There are actually quite a few things happening here in this test, but the most important part is the setup on line 13. Here we are setting up a test implementation of the widget, the provideLocalizedWidgetForTesting is a test utility I setup, you can read about it [HERE](https://dev.to/remejuan/bringing-localization-into-your-widget-testing-71f).

As the resulting Snackbar also makes use of context fot state access as well as localization I have included the LayoutBuilder to get hold of the context from the test utility.

The utility function itself is a Future and one of the easisest way to run those inside a widdget is with the FutureBuilder, which links back up to the future function on line 8. Here is simply included a short delay to help manage ui rendering within the test context, otherwise you end up with it failing as needsBuild getâ€™s called.

So once we have settled and pumped that additional second, we are now able to expect the Widget that should be rendered on the screen.

As mentioned above, not a very common usecase, and when possible one should always keep UI and Utilities seperate, and after having written this I had found a better way to deal with it in my use case, a way that did not involve returning a widget from a utility.

I felt however the learning itself was still valuable, and the possibility does exist that this is an unavoidable scenario for someone, or even myself at a later stage. # SharingIsCaring
