      Hi there, names Reme and I spend my working hours on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) projects and before that I spent many years working with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org).
      <p>I write a lot about testing in Flutter, having come across many complex scenarios writing large scale Flutter applications, and had the privilege of presenting at the Google Developer conference in April 2021.</p>
      <p>Outside of work I really enjoy Mountain Biking, Trail Running, Hiking and in general just being outdoors.</p>
